# **CrewAI-Powered Medical Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant**

## **Overview**

The **CrewAI-Powered Medical Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant** is an advanced AI system designed to assist in diagnosing medical conditions and providing personalized treatment plans. Utilizing **CrewAI**, **Gemini LLM**, and other AI-powered tools, this system takes in patient symptoms and medical history, analyzes them, and generates a detailed diagnosis along with a step-by-step treatment plan. The results are compiled into a professional Word document, making it easy for healthcare professionals and patients to review the AI-generated analysis and recommendations.

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Medical Diagnosis**
The system is powered by a specialized **Medical Diagnostician Agent**. This agent takes input from the user about their symptoms and medical history, analyzes the data, and generates a list of possible diagnoses. By limiting the diagnosis to the most likely conditions, it helps narrow down the possibilities for further examination by a healthcare provider.

### 2. **Treatment Recommendations**
Once the diagnosis is made, a **Treatment Advisor Agent** generates a tailored treatment plan. This includes:
- Medications
- Lifestyle changes
- Follow-up care

These recommendations are based on current medical best practices and are tailored to the patient's unique medical background and symptoms.

### 3. **AI-Driven Agents**
The **Medical Diagnostician** and **Treatment Advisor** agents work together to simulate a virtual healthcare consultation. These agents rely on AI to interpret data and suggest relevant information from a wide range of medical resources and research. By integrating real-time web scraping and search capabilities, the system can offer up-to-date and accurate information.

### 4. **Web Scraping & Data Retrieval**
The system integrates powerful tools like the **ScrapeWebsiteTool** and **SerperDevTool**. These tools allow the AI agents to fetch relevant medical information from trusted sources across the web. This ensures that the diagnosis and treatment plan are based on the latest medical insights and research.

### 5. **Word Document Generation**
After generating the diagnosis and treatment plan, the results are saved in a well-structured **Word document**. This document can be shared, printed, or archived for future reference. The document includes:
- A detailed medical diagnosis
- A comprehensive treatment plan
- Structured, easy-to-read format

## **How It Works**

1. **Patient Input**: The user provides details about the patient's gender, age, symptoms, and medical history. These inputs are crucial for generating personalized medical advice.

2. **Diagnosis Process**: The **Medical Diagnostician Agent** analyzes the input data and uses AI to generate a preliminary diagnosis. This diagnosis focuses on the most likely medical conditions that match the given symptoms and medical history.

3. **Treatment Plan**: Based on the diagnosis, the **Treatment Advisor Agent** generates a step-by-step treatment plan that includes both medical interventions (medications) and lifestyle changes. The plan also provides guidance on follow-up care.

4. **Results Compilation**: The results, including the diagnosis and treatment plan, are compiled into a Word document, which is then saved for the user to download and review.

## **Usage Flow**

1. **User Interaction**: The user (or patient) interacts with the system by providing essential details like age, gender, symptoms, and medical history.
   
2. **Diagnosis Generation**: The **Medical Diagnostician** analyzes the input and produces a list of potential medical conditions.
   
3. **Treatment Recommendations**: The **Treatment Advisor** creates a personalized treatment plan based on the diagnosis.
   
4. **Output**: The results are compiled into a Word document (`medical_diagnosis_treatment_plan.docx`), ready for download.

## **Technology Stack**

- **CrewAI**: Used to manage and execute the AI agents responsible for diagnosis and treatment.
- **Gemini LLM**: A state-of-the-art language model used to power the diagnostic and treatment recommendation agents.
